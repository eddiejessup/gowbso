GOWBSO
======

Make CSV files for uploading to the WBSO tool.

Installation
------------

Assuming you have pip installed, you can run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gowbso --user

Omit ``--user`` if you are running in a Python virtual environment, but otherwise keep it: don't use sudo, it's a dangerous route because it modifies the Python environment that your operating system may rely on.

Usage
-----

See the examples directory.
