# GOWBSO

Make CSV files for uploading to the WBSO tool.

## Installation

Assuming you have pip installed, you can run

```bash
pip install gowbso --user
```

Omit `--user` if you are running in a Python virtual environment, but otherwise keep it: don't use sudo, it's a dangerous route because it modifies the Python environment that your operating system may rely on.

## Usage

See the examples directory.
